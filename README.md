# wayspace installation procedure
Currently way space works locally (and needs 2 terminals, one for frontend and one for backend)

1. Go and download Node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/   // Note you will need to download the installer
2. After you have downloaded the installer, run the setup wizard. Just keep clicking next until node has been installed.
3. Once setup has been completed, you will need to go into cmd and go to the wayspace project folder (after you have extracted the zip file)
4. Once inside the project folder, you'll need to cd into the frontend folder (the path for example would be C:\Users\Home\Downloads\wayspace-main\frontend )
5. Type npm install, wait for the installation process to be completed
6. Whilst still inside the frontend folder, type npm start (this will start the frontend website after a while)
7. Open up another cmd terminal and make your way back to the project folder
8. Once inside, you'll need to change directory into the backend folder
9. Type npm install, wait for the installation process to be completed
10. Whilst still inside the backend folder, type npm start (this will start the backend server)

That is the installation process - you will have 2 terminals, one for the backend and frontend and the system will be hosted locally (the project will open up in a new internet tab)
